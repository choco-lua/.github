# Welcome to Choco! 🍫✨

> [!CAUTION]
> Choco is not ready, and we are not sure if this approach is possible or viable. It is entirely experimental, but hypothetically possible.

Choco is an experimental game framework designed for concurrency. Rather than acting as a glorified folder like most other frameworks, it aims to intelligently sort tasks at hand and execute them concurrently, thus *theoretically* improving performance.
