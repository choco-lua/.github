Choco is an experimental game framework designed for concurrency. Rather than acting as a glorified folder like most other frameworks, it aims to intelligently sort tasks at hand and execute them concurrently, thus *theoretically* improving performance.

# Contribution

Choco is currently an internal project, and cannot be contributed to. We plan on opening our doors once choco achieves the MVP ("Minimum Viable Product") status. Sorry!
